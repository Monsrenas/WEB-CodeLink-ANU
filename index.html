                In today's business world, technology is an essential component for the efficient operation and sustainable growth of any company. Although there are numerous software tools that facilitate the automation processes of our work, all of them have a generic nature and most of the time we need to complement several to try to create a computer system that covers the specific needs of our work and, even so, there are always elements left out of the process in addition to the increased probability of errors due to the necessary transition of information between programs that, as a rule, were not created with the idea of compatibility.
